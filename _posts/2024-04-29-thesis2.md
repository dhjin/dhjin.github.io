Bilingual word embeddings, which represent
lexicons of different languages in a shared embedding space, are essential for supporting semantic and knowledge transfers in a variety of
cross-lingual NLP tasks. Existing approaches
to training bilingual word embeddings require
often require pre-defined seed lexicons that are
expensive to obtain, or parallel sentences that
comprise coarse and noisy alignment. In contrast, we propose BilLex that leverages publicly available lexical definitions for bilingual
word embedding learning. Without the need
of predefined seed lexicons, BilLex comprises
a novel word pairing strategy to automatically identify and propagate the precise finegrained word alignment from lexical definitions. We evaluate BilLex in word-level and
sentence-level translation tasks, which seek to
find the cross-lingual counterparts of words
and sentences respectively. BilLex significantly outperforms previous embedding methods on both tasks.
