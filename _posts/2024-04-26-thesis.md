Bilingual Word Embeddings (BWEs) are one of the cornerstones of cross-lingual transfer of NLP models. They can be built
using only monolingual corpora without supervision leading to numerous works focusing on unsupervised BWEs. However,
most of the current approaches to build unsupervised BWEs do not compare their results with methods based on easy-to-access
cross-lingual signals. In this paper, we argue that such signals should always be considered when developing unsupervised
BWE methods. The two approaches we find most effective are: 1) using identical words as seed lexicons (which unsupervised
approaches incorrectly assume are not available for orthographically distinct language pairs) and 2) combining such lexicons
with pairs extracted by matching romanized versions of words with an edit distance threshold. We experiment on thirteen
non-Latin languages (and English) and show that such cheap signals work well and that they outperform using more complex
unsupervised methods on distant language pairs such as Chinese, Japanese, Kannada, Tamil, and Thai. In addition, they are even
competitive with the use of high-quality lexicons in supervised approaches. Our results show that these training signals should
not be neglected when building BWEs, even for distant languages.
